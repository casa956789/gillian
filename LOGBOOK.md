# Development Logbook for Gillian Moore's B&B Website

This logbook details the development activities and resolutions for the Gillian Moore's B&B website project.

## Week 1: Project Setup and Initial Development

**Activities:**
*   Analyzed assessment brief and business case to understand project requirements.
*   Defined website page structure and navigation flow (Home, Accommodation, Local Area & Activities, Contact & Booking).
*   Planned User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, including layout, fonts, and color scheme.
*   Identified and prepared appropriate graphics and media for the website.
*   Outlined content for each page, ensuring all business case information was included.
*   Researched and planned for accessibility features and semantic web standards (WCAG 2.1, HTML5 semantics).
*   Determined specific HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript implementation strategies.
*   Created the project directory structure: `gillian-moore-bnb/`, `css/`, `js/`, `images/`.
*   Developed the HTML structure for all planned pages (`index.html`, `accommodation.html`, `local_area.html`, `contact.html`).
*   Implemented basic CSS for styling and responsive design (`style.css`).
*   Added basic JavaScript for interactivity (`script.js`).
*   Integrated selected graphics and media into the `images/` directory and linked them in HTML.
*   Documented accessibility techniques used in the website (`ACCESSIBILITY.md`).

**Resolutions:**
*   Resolved initial `mkdir` command syntax error for Windows by using separate commands for each directory.
*   Ensured all HTML files are linked correctly to the CSS and JavaScript files.
*   Confirmed image paths are correct after copying.

**Next Steps:**
*   Write a reflection on the web development process.
*   Prepare all project files for submission in a compressed ZIP format.
*   Ensure all assessment requirements and criteria are met before final submission.
